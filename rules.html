        <p><strong>Last play:</strong> once someone calls “last play”, the <strong>next time the ball goes out</strong> ends the game. If last play is a <strong>corner</strong>, it ends on the <strong>next ball-out after the corner</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How to Submit Match Stats (Captains)</h2>

    <div class="rule">
      <p>Captains must send match stats to <strong>Shark</strong> on the evening of the game, in the following format:</p>

      <div class="format-box">
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>List each goal with <strong>scorer + assist</strong> (assist can be “none”).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>OTFs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>List who hit them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Clean sheet (if any):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm <strong>which players were officially in goal and in defence</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>MOTM / Honourable Mentions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>State the MOTM and any honourable mentions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Contenders:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If there were any <strong>Goal of the Season</strong> / <strong>Save of the Season</strong> contenders, include a short description.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="note"><strong>Clean sheets:</strong> points are awarded for whoever is <strong>officially recorded</strong> as in goal and in defence for the team with the clean sheet.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="rules-card">
    <h2>OTF Rules</h2>

    <div class="rule">
      <p>An OTF is only awarded when it’s properly launched over the fence.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Does not count</strong> if it’s a <strong>save by the keeper</strong> that goes over.</li>
        <li><strong>Does not count</strong> if it hits the <strong>bar</strong> or <strong>bounces off a defender</strong> and goes over.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

      <div class="rules-card">
  <h2>How Player Value Is Calculated</h2>

  <div class="rule">
    <p><strong>Plain English version:</strong> the overall score is just a way of ranking how well people have actually contributed this season — not just goals, not just turning up, but overall impact. It’s always out of <strong>100</strong>, so everyone’s comparable.</p>

    <p><strong>A few key points:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s based on the whole <strong>2026 season</strong>, not just recent games.</li>
      <li>It’s designed to be fair across positions (defenders can score high too).</li>
      <li>Good stuff pushes your score up, bad stuff pulls it down.</li>
      <li>One freak game won’t swing things massively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What counts positively:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Man of the Match</strong> — big boost. If the group voted you MOTM, that matters.</li>
      <li><strong>MOTM + Captain in a win</strong> — even bigger boost.</li>
      <li><strong>Winning Captain</strong> — captaining a team to a win counts.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean sheets</strong> — rare, so they score highly (mainly DEF/GK).</li>
      <li><strong>Conceding exactly one goal (DEF / GK only)</strong> — a small positive. This rewards solid defensive performances that just miss a clean sheet</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Goals &amp; Assists</strong> — same weight. Most goals come from a pass anyway.</li>
      <li><strong>Overall win %</strong> — steady boost if you’re often on winning sides.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Attendance rule (anti-slacking):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The only “recent form” bit is games played in the <strong>last 10</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you’ve played <strong>3+</strong> of the last 10, no penalty at all.</li>
      <li>If you’ve played <strong>2 or fewer</strong>, there’s a penalty.</li>
      <li>That penalty is softened by how many games you’ve played overall.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">This stops people playing twice, topping the table, then disappearing.</p>

    <p><strong>Small negatives:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goals conceded</strong> — similar negative to a goal being positive.</li>
      <li><strong>Own goals</strong> — bigger negative (rare and usually costly).</li>
      <li><strong>OTFs</strong> — tiny negative, basically for comedy &amp; tie-breaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How the number works:</strong></p>
    <p>Everything gets weighted, added up, and scaled to <strong>£4.5m - £15.0m</strong>. Behind the scenes it keeps decimals, so if two people both show “13.4”, one might actually be 13.38 and the other 14.1 — and it sorts correctly.</p>

    <p class="note">It’s not perfect, and it’s not set in stone — but it’s fair, explainable, and matches how we actually play.</p>
